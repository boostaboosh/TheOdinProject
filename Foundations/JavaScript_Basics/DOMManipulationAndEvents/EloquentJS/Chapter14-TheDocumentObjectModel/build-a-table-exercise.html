        {name: "Everest", height: 8848, place: "Nepal"},

      // Your code here
      /* 
      step 1) understand the problem:
      
      Given an array of objects with name, height, and place 
      properties; generate a DOM structure for a HTML table
      with a header row at the top listing object property names, or keys, 
      as column headings,
      and remaining rows containg the property values of one object per row.
      All objects should be listed in the table.
      
      Accomplish this by automatically deriving the columns from the objects,
      by taking the property names of the first object in the data.
      
      Add the resulting table element to the DOM so that it becomes visible in the 
      document. Do this by adding it to the pre-existing div element 
      with an id attribute value of "mountains".
      
      Once you have this working right align cells that contain number values by
      setting their style.textAlign property to right.

      step 2) plan how you are going to solve the problem:
        - Does your program have a user interface? 
          What will it look like? 
          What functionality will the interface have? Sketch it out on paper.
          My program does not have a user interface.
        - What inputs will your program have?
          Will the user enter the data or will you get input from somewhere else?
          My program will have one input.
          The input my program will have are the objects stored in the MOUNTAINS array.
        - What's the desired output?
          The desired output of my program is the creation of a document object model stucture which
          contains a HTML table with a header row listing the object property names of the objects
          inside the MOUNTAINS array, and the following rows containing the property values of one 
          object per row.
        - Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?
          Write an algorithm to solve the problem. In other words, write a recipe for solving the
          problem. An algorithm defines the steps that need to be taken by the computer to solve a 
          problem in pseudocode.
