      /* 
      step 1) understand the problem:
      
      Given an array of objects with name, height, and place 
      properties; generate a DOM structure for a HTML table
      with a header row at the top listing object property names, or keys, 
      as column headings,
      and remaining rows containg the property values of one object per row.
      All objects should be listed in the table.
      
      Accomplish this by automatically deriving the columns from the objects,
      by taking the property names of the first object in the data.
      
      Add the resulting table element to the DOM so that it becomes visible in the 
      document. Do this by adding it to the pre-existing div element 
      with an id attribute value of "mountains".
      
      Once you have this working right align cells that contain number values by
      setting their style.textAlign property to right.
