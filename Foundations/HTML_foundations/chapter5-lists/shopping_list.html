        <!-- this is a html comment.
        the head element is the first child of my root element in a html document.
        the head element contains meta data for the html file.
        Meta data means data about data, so informationa about the data contained in the html file
        The head element should NOT contain any elements that display information to the user.
        The head element contains information that the browser or reader of the html file 
        needs in order to interpret/render the html file correctly.
        Importantly, it containes the meta element which contains the charset attribute
        that lets the browser know
        what character set was used to write the html document, usually UTF-8 
        (unicode transformation format - 8bit). If this is not specified the browser may not
        use a different character set and interpret the html document incorrectly
        and display incorrect symbols.
        Furthermore the head element contains the title element, which contains the name the 
        browser will display in the tab of the webpage created from the html document.
        If a title is not provided the browser will use the name of the html file
        as the tab name by default which is undesirable because it is not user friendly.
        For example, website home pages html files should be named index.html 
        in order for web servers to identify them as website homepages. 
        If you don't give your website homepage html document a title, it will
        display as index.html in the browser, which does indicate to a user 
        what webpage is open on a particular tab, which is very annoying if they
        have multiple tabs open.
